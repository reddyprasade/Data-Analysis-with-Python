## Seaborn Data Visulization

# Seaborn-Tutorial:

**Data Visualization** is a critical though undermined skill required in pursuit of a **Data Science** career. This repository is an attempt to help *Data Science* aspirants gain necessary **<span style="color:red">Data Visualization</span>** skills required to progress in their career. It includes all the types of plot offered by **Seaborn**, applied on *random* or *fabricated datasets*. The knowledge gained for inference shall in no way be limited to just Seaborn. 

## Agenda:
With this series of **<span style="color:red">Seaborn notebooks</span>**, aspirants shall achieve or be able to upgrade their skills on:
- Learn to use Pandas to have a brief overview of dataset.
- Learn to use various Seaborn plots.
- Learn to infer the representation of data distribution on any plot.
- Utilize underlying Matplotlib arguments to tweak Seaborn plots.
- Statistical interpretation of plotted data.
- In-depth usage & explanation of each available plotting parameter.
- Advanced customization as to satisfy complex real-world business problems.
- Custom codes for enhancing data visualization experience.
