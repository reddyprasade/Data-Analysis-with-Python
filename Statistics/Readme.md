## Statistics 

* Statistics is the discipline that concerns the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data.
* In applying statistics to a scientific, industrial, or social problem, it is conventional to begin with a statistical population or a statistical model to be studied.
* Populations can be diverse groups of people or objects such as "all people living in a country" or "every atom composing a crystal". 
* Statistics deals with every aspect of data, including the planning of data collection in terms of the design of surveys and experiments.
* When census data cannot be collected, statisticians collect data by developing specific experiment designs and survey samples.
* Representative sampling assures that inferences and conclusions can reasonably extend from the sample to the population as a whole. 
* Two main statistical methods are used in data analysis
    *   Descriptive statistics
    *   Inferential statistics
