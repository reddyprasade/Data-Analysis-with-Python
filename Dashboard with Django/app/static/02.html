<h1> US envoy meets Tamil Nadu governor</h1>
<hr>


<p>CHENNAI <br>US ambassador to India Kenneth I Juster called on Tamil Nadu Governor Banwarilal Purohit at Raj Bhavan here on Tuesday.
An official release said the diplomat had explained the keen interest being shown by the US to strengthen ties with India. The potential to increase investment in Tamil Nadu was also being examined seriously, it said.</p>
<p>We think a three-member gang murdered him. We have secured two of them and are quizzing them. Special teams are on the lookout for the third and main accused, Tirunelveli district superintendent of police P Ve Arunsakthikumar told TOI after conducting inquiries on the spot.</p>
<p>The governor mentioned the strategic advantages in terms of technical, manpower, infrastructural and port facilities the state enjoyed and wished that the visit would promote greater investment in Tamil Nadu and stronger cultural exchanges.
</p>
<p>&#34The governor added that all support will be given to initiatives taken to promote industry, skill development and investment in Tamil Nadu in a fair and transparent manner,&#34 the release said.</p>

<p>In his official Twitter handle, @USAmbIndia, Juster tweeted that he very much enjoyed the meeting with the governor. &#34Great discussion on ways to advance US India trade.&#34</p>
<p>On Monday, Kenneth called on chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami at the secretariat and later tweeted that he had a great discussion on India-US bilateral relations and economic development.</p>
<p>The diplomat also posted pictures of his visit to Ice House. &#34A wonderful visit to the Ice House, which in 1840s stored ice shipped from the US to south India. A great example of the long history of US-south India trade,&#34 he said.
